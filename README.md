  #### Transcript
  * __User:__ When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I'm 70 how old is my sister? 
  * __ChatGPT:__ If you are 70 years old and your sister was half your age when you were 6, then your sister was 6 years old, <<6/2=3>>3 years old when you were 6. If your sister was 3 years old when you were 6 and you are now 70, then your sister is now 3 + 70 = <<3+70=73>>73 years old. So your sister is 73 years old.
  
  #### Notes
  - ***Correct answer:*** 67
  - ***Mistake:*** ChatGPT replied 73 instead of 67
